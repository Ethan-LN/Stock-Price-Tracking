# üìà Stock Price Traking and Prediction Project

Welcome to the Gold Price Prediction project! This project aims to predict gold prices in the stock market using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a client-server architecture with React as the front-end framework, .NET Web and .NET Core as the back-end frameworks, and Python machine learning models integrated for data analysis. The project also includes Docker for containerization and Azure Cloud for deployment.

## üöÄ Features

- Retrieve stock price data from Yahoo Finance API.
- Train and deploy machine learning models for stock price prediction.
- Build a web application using React and Tailwind CSS for a user-friendly interface.
- Utilize .NET Web and .NET Core for server-side development and API implementation.
- Containerize the application with Docker for easy deployment.
- Host and deploy the application using Azure Cloud services.
- Implement unit tests following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles for code quality assurance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- Front-end: React, Tailwind CSS
- Back-end: .NET Web, .NET Core
- Machine Learning: Python
- Database: MSSQL/MYSQL
- Containerization: Docker
- Cloud Deployment: Azure

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the React front-end application.
- `backend/`: Contains the .NET Web and .NET Core back-end applications.
- `ml/`: Includes Python scripts for data analysis and machine learning models.
- `docker/`: Contains Dockerfile and related configuration files for containerization.
- `tests/`: Includes unit tests for different components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository from the Github/Jira repository to your local machine.
2. Set up Azure Cloud for hosting and deployment. Choose either Azure Web Apps or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration.
3. Install the necessary tools:
   - A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
   - Git for version control.
   - Docker for local containerized development.
   - Python for machine learning model development.
4. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for automated build, testing, and deployment.
5. Install the required dependencies and libraries for React, .NET, and Python.

## üèó  Development Process

Follow these steps to contribute to the project:

1. Use the GitHub/Jira repository for project management and issue tracking. Create and assign tasks to team members as needed.
2. Implement the front-end using React and Tailwind CSS. Focus on creating reusable components and ensuring responsive design.
3. Develop the .NET backend, including API endpoints for data retrieval and integration with the Yahoo Finance API.
4. Integrate the Python machine learning models into the .NET backend. Ensure seamless communication and data exchange between the two frameworks.
5. Write unit tests using the chosen testing framework (e.g., xUnit or NUnit) following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.
6. Continuously integrate and deploy the application using the established CI/CD pipeline. Monitor and debug issues as they arise.

## üö¢  Deployment

To deploy the application on Azure Cloud:

1. Configure the Azure environment for hosting the application, either using Azure Web Apps or AKS.
2. Set up the necessary configurations for the deployment, including environment variables and connection strings.
3. Utilize Docker to build container images for the front-end and back-end components.
4. Deploy the Docker containers to Azure Cloud using the chosen deployment method.

## üß™ Testing

1. Write unit tests for each component, ensuring maximum code coverage.
2. Execute the unit tests locally or integrate them into the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing.
3. Perform manual testing to validate the application's functionality, user experience, and data predictions.
